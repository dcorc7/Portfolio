    "text": "I graduated from Virginia Tech’s Pamplin College of Business in May 2022 with two degrees in Business Information Technology and Finance, and a minor in Economics. Immediately after graduation, I worked for two years in McLean, VA as a Federal Technology Risk Management Associate at KPMG. In this role, I gained hands-on experience in IT control audit readiness, segregation of duties (SoD), identity and access management (ICAM), and inventory management, where I contributed to improving risk mitigation processes, creating corrective action plan (CAP) downgrade packages, and aligning IT controls with regulatory requirements.\nIn August 2024, I began to pursue a Masters in Data Science and Analytics at Georgetown University. In this program, I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning, database management, statistics, preditive modeling, and natural language processing (NLP). I am eager to apply my knowledge in data-driven decision-making to future roles in technology, where I hope to leverage the data science concepts I have learned while attending this program.\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nGeorgetown University\nWashington D.C. | Expected Graduation: May 2026\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMS in Data Science & Analytics\nMerit Scholarship Recipient\n\n\n\nVirginia Polytechnic and State University (Virginia Tech)\nBlacksburg, VA | Graduated: May 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBS in Business Information Technology (BIT) | Computer Decision Support Systems (DSS)\nBS in Finance | Investment Management\nEconomics Minor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork Experience\nNASA - Data & Analytics Intern\nLos Angeles, CA | June 2025 - August 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork in Progress\n\n\n\n\nKPMG - Federal Technology Risk Management Associate\nMcLean, VA | July 2022 - July 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssisted in the creation of an SoD governance document, recommending IT goverance structure solutions and SoD frameworks\nPerformed walkthoughs, tests of design, and tests of effectiveness for SAP IT system controls to identify inter-site discrepancies, system errors, and internal control gaps\nCompleted a corrective action plan (CAP) downgrade package for SoD and ICAM notices of findings and recommendation (NFRs)\n\nThe CAP downgrade package consisted of an end-to-end (E2E) process document, control gap analysis, posting logic assessment, risk and control matrix, and responsibility-accountability matrix.\n\nInitiated a DoD agency’s enterprise-wide SoD and ICAM implementation effort, involving the creation of a program governance charter, current-state SoD/ICAM assessment, and Microsoft PowerBI monitoring dashboard\n\n\n\nTIC Summer Camp - Python Programming Counseler\nMcLean, VA | June 2021 - August 2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaught campers aged 6 - 18 Python programming funamentals (variables, syntax, loops, functions, classes) using Processing 3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Skills\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
