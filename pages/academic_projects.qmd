# {{< fa code >}} "HokieEats" Food Delivery Service:

I was tasked with creating a database-driven “review management” module for a fictional food delivery service website and integrating it with other team member’s sections of the project. I created 9 webpages using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, D3.js, Ajax, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, all focused on user review creation, modification, and analysis.

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Bootstrap, J3.DS, Ajax
